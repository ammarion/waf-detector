# Detection Techniques Task Tracker

This document tracks the progress of Detection Techniques (Section 11) and the prerequisite WAF smoke test porting. Each task includes its rationale, status, dependencies, and detailed subtasks. **Between each major task, we must validate that everything works end-to-end (CLI, API, UI).**

## Validation Between Tasks
- [ ] After each major task, perform end-to-end validation:
    - [ ] CLI: All new/changed features work as expected
    - [ ] API: Endpoints behave correctly, including error handling
    - [ ] UI: User experience is correct, errors and feedback are clear
    - [ ] Regression: No existing features are broken
    - [ ] Update this file with results and check off completed items
