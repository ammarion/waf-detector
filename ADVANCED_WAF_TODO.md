# Advanced WAF Detector TODO

## Phase 1: Expand Bypass Techniques and Attack Categories (Short-term)
- [ ] Research and collect advanced WAF bypass payloads (encoding, obfuscation, fragmentation)
- [ ] Add encoding variations (URL, HTML, Unicode, Base64, mixed)
- [ ] Add obfuscation techniques (inline comments, case, whitespace, normalization)
- [ ] Add fragmentation/multipart payloads
- [ ] Expand attack categories to 10+ (SSRF, XXE, Template Injection, Deserialization, CORS, Open Redirect, Host Header Injection, HTTP Parameter Pollution, etc.)
- [ ] Populate new categories with relevant payloads
- [ ] Update reporting to show bypass technique used per payload
- [ ] Enhance UI/CLI to display new results and evasion resistance

## Phase 2: Adaptive Payloads (Medium-term)
- [ ] Implement basic technology fingerprinting (headers, errors, favicon, etc.)
- [ ] Map detected technologies to relevant payloads
- [ ] Generate adaptive payloads based on stack

## Phase 3: Long-term Enhancements
- [ ] Build database of technology-specific payloads
- [ ] Add new evasion techniques as research emerges
